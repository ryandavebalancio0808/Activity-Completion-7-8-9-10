    WHY TAKE A TESDA COURSE?
    </h3>
    <p>
    I want to pursue the training on web designing mainly because I want to learn to express myself creatively on the internet. I want to discover my web development skills and I know that web development is a fun, creative experience.

    THOUGHTS AS A TESDA TRAINEE
    </H3>
    <P>
    Right from the start of the pandemic, I already have an eye in attending a TESDA program, but my inability to go to TESDA physically due to my online classes has hindered it. But now, I am able to join, thanks to my professor who gave me the information that TESDA is now offering online courses with the help of GESTAAC Inc. From the first and second day of our training, I found it hard, catching up with the scheduled attendance  for the time-in and time-out. And also, since our program is online based, I was thankful that it was recorded for me to watch the discussion when I get home from school. I've done my activities, and tasks. And I can't wait to learn more. My initial thought is that TESDA really gives opportunity by giving comprehensive skills training to those who want to learn technical-vocational education.
